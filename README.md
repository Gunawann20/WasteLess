Hunger and food waste are two highly important and interrelated issues. On one hand, the food waste generated every day can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. On the other hand, hunger remains a serious problem in many countries around the world. Considering the interconnection between the two, efforts to reduce food waste and distribute edible food can help address the problem of hunger and minimize the negative impacts of food waste on the environment. To address this issue, there is a need for a solution that can connect food donors with those in need and redistribute extra food in a safe and efficient way. An application with a user-friendly interface that ensures the safety and quality of donated food can help improve food accessibility and reduce food waste.
